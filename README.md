# LogStash Grok Patterns

At [PCextreme](https://www.pcextreme.nl/aurora). we use [LogStash](http//www.logstash.net/). in combination with [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/). to store most of our logs.

One thing we found is that although Grok has a lot of great build-in patterns, it sometimes is very hard to
pare specific logs.

Since we are Open Source minded we thought it was a good idea to publish the LogStash Grok patterns we are using.

Most of them go with a bit of LogStash configuration as well to you can see how we use them.
